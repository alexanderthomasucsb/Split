#TODO: finalize brief commentary on team member code (and/or other) contributions 

Suggestion: each team member should initially create a draft of their part in 
team/contributions/contrib_Alice.md, team/contributions/contrib_Bob.md, team/contributions/contrib_Carol.md, team/contributions/contrib_Danny.md…

Then: the person assembling the overall CONTRIBS.md report can copy/paste those separate files into one unified CONTRIBS.md file.

In a team meeting before the deadline: Review and discuss the /graphs/contributors report for your project repo.
You can find it by clicking “insights” then “contributors”.
