Overall, I helped create the manual document which helped demonstrate the purpose of our app and showed all the features that it contains from the manual split, to the bill scan, and much more. I also tried to work on the firebase and Oauth for the app initally, but some of my other teamates were able to do it. I made a progess bar that visually tracks how much of a certiain bill has been paid and automatically updates. I need to decide with the rest of the team if we want to merge that into main. As of now, I'm working on adding a spending insights feature and a onboarding that appears that shows the user how to use the app when they first sign up
