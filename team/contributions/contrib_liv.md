I drafted our design and manual documents, with Aneesh helping with the manual. I also updated our README.md to more accurately reflect our product. 

I followed a pair programming approach with Nadav, and he was the member who did the commits for our code. I also assumed a leadership role throughout the course, which 
was not as reflected in the commits. I often helped in a project manager sense of keeping the team on track and sending the team reminders before deadlines, following up with teammates who missed class. 

While pair programming w Nadav, I implemented the API functionality with Veryfi OCR. We added the functionality for adding a bill both manually and with a photo (scanning a receipt). 
We also drafted and made the main layout of our app, with the home page. We also implemented the friend request logic so users can send friend requests to other valid users, accept/decline friend requests, and remove friends.
