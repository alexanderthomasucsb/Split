Overall I conducted a user survey, where I had users try the app and give feedback on what changes they would like to see and would improve the user experience of the app the most. After that, I spent the rest of the time adressing the main concerns that the users brought up. This included introducing a user search function so that users can add friends easier, modifying the home page so that bills are seperated by status, and adding the ability to split bills by item when adding them manually.
