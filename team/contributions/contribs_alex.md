# planning
acted as procuct manager, came up with initial idea, and contributed to initial vision of the app
# set up
set up first app, although we switched to a different app set up by Nadav, as it was better
# First feature
implemented initial bill splitting logic although it was significantly changed over time
# Working towards MVP 
Added quality of life changes for the user such as receipt image zoom and worked on adding friends to bills functionality. Handled updating app to new expo version which involved replacing / updating a couple libraries. I also think I made myself available and helpful when team mates would run into bugs or issues running the code
# Hw 4: 
Overall I conducted a user evaluations, where I had users try the app and give feedback on what changes they would like to see and would improve the user experience of the app the most. After that, I spent the rest of the time adressing the main concerns that the users brought up. This included introducing a user search function so that users can add friends easier, modifying the home page so that bills are seperated by: payment status / created / recieved; and upgrading our manual bill splitting feature to allow for more customization when splitting a bill compared to our rigid options for manually splitting a bill that we had before.
# Final Sprint
More user quality of life changes and venmo integration for in app payments
* added additional bill info that users might find useful on home page and bill details page. E.g. date created / paid, amount still owed for user, bill creator
* Added a host of features that used venmo: paying bills with venmo in app using a webview component, adding venmo information to your profile, verifying venmo user name matches the account you want to connect to, able to settle bills from the home screen using venmo, etc.

# Note on contributions
I often did large commits that covered multiple issues at once
