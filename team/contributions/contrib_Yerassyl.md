Overall, I helped with the documentation of the notes for the bill splitting apps working on the notes looking correct. I tried working on the UI for the app and the better functionality for the user. I completed the MVP video and MVP persentation. I am working on the improvement of the friends feature and the UI improvement making it very easy for the user to use making sure that theyw on't be confused when they login into the app and be able to use straight away while sharing the app with the friend easily.
