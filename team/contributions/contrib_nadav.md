I wrote a lot of the code for the app as reflected in the commit history. 
I worked with the team to make sure that everything was getting done on time, as well as assigning new tasks to people on the kanban board to make sure we were getting new features
implemented. Working with the rest of the group, we iterated on the app refining it throughout the quarter through different sprints and HWs inclduing
the most recent HW04 where I specifically tackled the issue of design, and simplified the functionality and design of our app in order to make sure that we address
the feedback we got from the MVP as well as create a stronger app identity.
