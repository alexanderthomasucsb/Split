# Three things we'd like feedback on:
* How can we make the process of creating bills easier / where to encounter issues or difficulties when first navigating the app
* We have a couple different options to split bills: by item, percentage of entire bill, manual entry. Are there any other ways to split a bill that a user would like to see
* Would you use our current product / if so what features make it worth using over different applications for bill splitting, if not what features could we add if any that would make it worth using.
* In general what new features do you think should be added immediately to improve the quality of the app.
